# Heart Diagnosis
This app will take inputs (genric)
 and uses Logistic Regression to analyse the condition of heart and gives suggestions based on report
This app also takes mri scan to tell whether this heart is healthy or not
https://hearttt.herokuapp.com/ (For genric inputs)
https://hearttmri.herokuapp.com/ (For mri scans)

Future improvements:
I'm gonna combine both the apps into one
